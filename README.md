# Spotify Data Exploration
 
This is my course assignment.

I use spotify data to do some exploration. The data I'm using is a list of songs start from 1960 - 2023. And it contains the duration of the song, artists, popularity, tempo, etc. 

The exploration contains data visualization, regex, and statistical method.
